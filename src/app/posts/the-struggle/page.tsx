          One of the great traditions I have with Pepe, one of the co-founders of Palenca, is to give each other books related to startups and tech. It started when I was an intern in the summer of 2021, we were in the middle of Y Combinator (which was remote in those days) and were about to begin our fundraising process. I gave the three co-founders a copy of the book “Venture Deals” by Brad Feld, I thought it would be a helpful guide for them to navigate the process. Antoine, the most technical of the three, had the most memorable response to my gift, he asked me “Do I need to read all this?”. But with Pepe it began this tradition of giving each other books.         </div>
        <div className="pb-5">
          One of the books he gave me was “The Hard Thing About Hard Things” by Ben Horowitz; which is a particularly excellent book to read during the process of working in a startup. There was one essay in particular that I thought would hit home the hardest, because I read a tweet about it form Dryden Brown, the founder of Praxis, and a dude I generally admire:

        <div className="pb-5">
          Oddly, it didn&apos;t really hit home. Because I wasn&apos;t in The Struggle.

          A few months in, the cracks began to show. We had only closed two small clients, and one of them closed their operations. We were placing all of our chips on one very large deal with a local giant and it was taking months and months to see the slightest sliver of progress. All our other sales processes were stalled. Eleven companies that had agreed to start pilots with us were not responding to our emails, thirty-six companies that had met with us more than once would no longer meet with us, twenty-four companies that responded to emails but would not take a call, and forty-seven companies that would not even respond to our first emails. To make matters worse, our competitors were not only kicking our ass closing clients, they were also launching the exact same products we had, which was our only differentiator. The founders were aware and asking questions. Why weren&apos;t we closing more clients, why weren&apos;t more prospects testing our products, why weren&apos;t we having more meetings.

        <div className="pb-5">
          “The market isn&apos;t quite where it was supposed to be. You lose a competitive battle. You lose a loyal customer. You lose a great employee. The walls start closing in. Where did you go wrong? Why didn&apos;t your company perform as envisioned? Are you good enough to do this? As your dreams turn into nightmares, you find yourself in The Struggle.”
        </div>
        <div className="pb-5">
          To make matters worse, this coincided exactly with the time when I was trying to renegotiate my contract with the founders. I wanted more equity in the company. I felt I “deserved” this because of the risk I took coming to Brazil. You don&apos;t deserve shit in this world.

          The Struggle is when people ask you why you don&apos;t quit and you don&apos;t know the answer.

          The Struggle is when you know that you are in over your head and you know that you cannot be replaced.

          The Struggle is when everybody thinks you are an idiot, but nobody will fire you.

          The Struggle is when you are having a conversation with someone and you can&apos;t hear a word that they are saying because all you can hear is The Struggle.

          The Struggle is when you want the pain to stop. The Struggle is unhappiness.

          The Struggle is when you go on vacation to feel better and you feel worse.

          The Struggle is when you are surrounded by people and you are all alone. The Struggle has no mercy.

          This was not my first time in a struggle. In November 2020, I was finishing my last round of chemotherapy. This was the second time I&apos;d had testicular cancer. I still had one surgery left, they would take out the remains of the tumors that the chemotherapies did not wipe out and check if there were still any cancer cells alive. If there were, as had happened the first time I had cancer, the outlook did not look very good. I had taken an experimental treatment which significantly increased the doses of chemotherapy, increasing the chances of removing cancer, but with the trade off that the doses are so high and toxic that your body will no longer be able to endure any more chemotherapy after. If you read the first part of this you can assume what happened. Everything worked out.

        <div className="pb-5">
          In that context, it&apos;s hard to justify how struggling in a startup compares to dying of cancer, but that&apos;s the point about the struggle. It&apos;s all consuming, it feels like there is no way out and like the center of the universe is sucking you in. But it also points to the most important thing about the struggle:
        </div>
        <div className="pb-5">
          You may not make it. That is why it is The Struggle.
          The Struggle is where greatness comes from.
        </div>
        <div className="pb-5">
          These are the experiences that either make or break you, as an entrepreneur, and as a person. The struggle is essential because it shows you your mortality (real or perceived, as in the two cases). You must learn to come close to the edge and be comfortable with it. If you want to live an extraordinary life, you must take extraordinary risks and endure extraordinary costs.
        </div>
        <div className="pb-5">
          In the end, there is always a way out, and the only thing that matters is surviving to see another day.

          Coming back to the initial part of the post, I&apos;m currently not out of the struggle, things look incredibly gloomy in São Paulo. But to my enemies out there thirsting for my demise, good luck trying to kill me.

          I always get out of the struggle.

          Here is the original post from Ben Horowitz on The Struggle, I can&apos;t recommend it highly enough.
