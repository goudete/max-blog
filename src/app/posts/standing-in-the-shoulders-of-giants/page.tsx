          According to some accounts of history, when Julius Caesar stood in front of the tomb of Alexander the Great, he cried. He felt it was a matter of sorrow that by the age of 25 Alexander was already a great king and conqueror, and he had achieved so little at that age.

          As I dawn on my 26th birthday Im left with a very similar feeling. I am yet to be a powerful billionaire or a conqueror of countries. I&apos;ve only worked in a startup and have attempted to “conquer” Brazil with it, which I haven&apos;t yet. I have given serious consideration to raising a company of South African and Israeli mercenaries to take over a small Central American country and make a tax free, free-trade and tourist paradise, like a Singapore of Latin America. Would any venture capital funds be interested in funding this? Worst case scenario, the aesthetics would make for powerful marketing, like a modern day Che Guevara (I would also be wearing a Rolex).

          In all seriousness, working in a startup in Mexico and Brazil, I often think of what company I would like to found one day. Likely also in Latin America. But as I look around the broader ecosystem in Latin America for ideas on what to do I&apos;m left with the same feeling as Julius Caesar, there seems to be an incredible lack of ambition and authenticity in the ecosystem. Peter Thiel&apos;s book Zero to One talks about how we have not in fact been making very much technological progress, just nice iterations. He certainly wasn&apos;t talking about Latin America, but I think his point is even stronger for Latin America and gives us a lot to think about. The standard playbook of LatAm tech has been to be “X or Y for LatAm”, which can be good but so far there have only been two truly great companies to come out of the region with a version of that playbook: Mercado Libre (Amazon for LatAm) and Nubank (CapitalOne for LatAm). It can be easy to get confused by the noise, but at the end of the day I think many would agree. I think the issue is a lack of vision from founders and a lack of ambition from the venture capitalists.

          Another corporate charge card with excellent expense management software (Ramp or Brex for LatAm), that is WEAK SAUCE. Another neobank or fintech product to bank the underbanked with a very pretty app (Nubank for LatAm, what?), that is WEAK SAUCE and the throne has been taken by King David. I&apos;ve seen eight different companies that are building different versions of HR software (Rippling for LatAm), that is WEAK SAUCE. To be fair, it&apos;s not such weak sauce. I actually got pretty far along into the idea of founding a payroll system with a friend of mine a few months back, and Parker Conrad is one of my idols.

          There&apos;s many more things being built in different verticals, but in reality I think most would agree that we are not yet building anything that will move the needle substantially in terms of technological progress in the region. Most VC&apos;s for the region will say otherwise, and you can read all about their optimism on LinkedIn and in their blogs. I don&apos;t believe them, the only truly elite funds in the region were the ones that were involved in the previously mentioned companies (Kaszek), and there are others that are pretty good in Brazil as well, but when you read about how their portfolio companies are changing the world, you can think of them like many crypto bros talking about the great new coins and blockchains they were making in 2021. They are just shilling shitcoins and trying to sell them at a higher price to the next buyer.

          You should never take me seriously because I haven&apos;t built anything yet. I&apos;m a complete idiot with a generous amount of confidence. The point of my writing is entertainment, not to be a local thinkboi like some of the VC&apos;s. However I think many would agree that the startups we are building here stay in the shadows of others being built in other parts of the world. The model of X or Y for LatAm isn&apos;t bad, we just lack ambition with our ideas. Why aren&apos;t we building enormous launch pads in the Sonora Desert? If SpaceX begins launching more and more rockets in to orbit, we could surely lower some of those costs, or maybe start building the factories to make these rockets and drive the cost to launch even lower than it is now. We have a big security problem with narcos in Mexico, where is the Anduril of Mexico? Why haven&apos;t we used our manufacturing capacity to build sophisticated weapons systems in the Valle de Guadalupe? Have you seen the videos of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers laying waste to each other with the same drone your dipshit friend takes his surfing videos? Someone needs to give the Mexican government the same tools to take down sophisticated and heavily armed Cartels with drones operated by an engineer in an air conditioned room in Mexico City, instead of risking the lives of countless soldiers and civilians with firefights against criminals with better weapons than them.
